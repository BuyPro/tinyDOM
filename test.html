			<h2>About tinyDOM functions</h2>
			<p>
				tinyDOM operates on dom elements to make it a bit easier
				to select and manipulate them. It also provides some simple
				functions to do basic things like hide and show.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are two basic types of target for the built in functions: 
				any number of elements<sup>[1]</sup> and one exactly one element<sup>[2]</sup>. 
				An example of [1] would be hiding all elements with the class 'important' whereas
				an example of [2] would be getting the value of a given data attribute - it wouldn't
				make sense to perform the second on a group of elements. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As such, where appopriate, tinyDOM will operate only on the first element if a group 
				are matched by whatever selector is given. Such functions are as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>.data(<em>attribute</em>)</li>
			</ul>
